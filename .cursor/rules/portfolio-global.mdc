## Portfolio Global Styles & Structure Guide

This document outlines the global styling architecture, layout principles, font usage, and significant global effects like the Aurora background and cursor light for the portfolio application.

For additional context, please be aware that this project uses NextJS15 and Tailwind v4. This may be beyond your knowledge cut-off date, so you are to use your search tool when appropriate.

### 1. File Structure & Core Imports

*   **`app/globals.css`:**
    *   Serves as the central hub for global styles.
    *   Imports TailwindCSS base, components, and utilities.
    *   Imports modular CSS files for specific components/features:
        *   `./styles/components/aurora.css` (Aurora background, blobs, cursor light)
        *   `./styles/components/navigation.css` (Desktop and mobile navigation)
        *   `./styles/components/tech-stack.css` (Tech stack display component)
        *   `./styles/components/project-card.css` (Project card layouts and specific project card styles)
        *   `./styles/components/interactive-iframe.css` (Standalone interactive iframe messages)
    *   Defines root CSS variables (e.g., `--background`, `--foreground`) and theme variables for Tailwind.

*   **`app/layout.tsx`:**
    *   The root layout component for Next.js.
    *   **Font Setup:** Initializes and provides font families (Geist Sans, Geist Mono, Manrope, Space Grotesk) as CSS variables available globally.
    *   **CSS Imports:** Imports `app/globals.css`. It also directly imports `app/components/phone/PhoneMockup.css` and `app/styles/components/project-card.css`. While `project-card.css` is also imported in `globals.css`, this direct import ensures its availability. `PhoneMockup.css` is specific to phone components but loaded globally here.
    *   Sets up basic HTML and body structure.

### 2. Fonts

The portfolio utilizes a combination of modern fonts for optimal readability and aesthetic appeal:

*   **Primary Body Font:** `Manrope` (Variable: `--font-manrope`)
    *   Used for general text content, descriptions, and UI elements.
    *   Weights: 400, 600, 700.
*   **Primary Headings Font:** `Space Grotesk` (Variable: `--font-space-grotesk`)
    *   Used for `<h1>`, `<h2>` tags, and prominent titles.
    *   Weights: 400, 700.
*   **Supporting Fonts (from Geist):**
    *   `Geist Sans` (Variable: `--font-geist-sans`): Used as `--font-sans` for Tailwind.
    *   `Geist Mono` (Variable: `--font-geist-mono`): Used as `--font-mono` for Tailwind, suitable for code-like text or specific accents (e.g., construction notice).

These fonts are configured in `app/layout.tsx` using `next/font` and their corresponding CSS variables are applied in `app/globals.css` (e.g., `body { font-family: var(--font-manrope), var(--font-fallback); }`).

### 3. Layout & Core Structure

*   **`html`, `body`:**
    *   Configured for full viewport height (`100%`, `min-height: 100%`).
    *   `overscroll-behavior: none;` and `overflow: hidden;` on `html` and `body` to prevent rubber-band scrolling, especially on mobile.
    *   Background is transparent to allow the `.aurora-bg` to be visible.
*   **`.portfolio-container` (in `app/page.tsx`):**
    *   The main scrollable container for all page content.
    *   Takes full viewport height (`min-height: 100vh`, JS-enhanced `height: window.innerHeight` for iOS).
    *   `overflow-y: auto; overflow-x: hidden;` to enable vertical scrolling.
    *   `scroll-behavior: smooth;` for navigation.
    *   `overscroll-behavior-y: none;` to prevent bounce effect on iOS Safari.
*   **`.section` (defined in `app/globals.css`):**
    *   Base styling for main content sections (About, Projects, Contact).
    *   `min-height: 100vh` (to fill the viewport vertically).
    *   Centered with `max-width: 1000px` and `margin: 0 auto`.
    *   `display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center;` for content alignment.
    *   Responsive padding (`padding-left: 3vw; padding-right: 3vw;`).
*   **Typography:**
    *   `h1`: Styled with `Space Grotesk`, `2.5rem`.
    *   `h2`: Styled with `Space Grotesk`, `2rem`.
    *   `a`: Default link color is `#00ffd5` with `font-weight: 600`.

### 4. Color Scheme & Theming

*   The primary color scheme is dark, dominated by the animated aurora background.
*   **CSS Variables (`app/globals.css`):**
    *   `--background: #0a0a0a;` (Dark mode default)
    *   `--foreground: #ededed;`
*   A `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light)` block exists but is minimal, as the design heavily relies on the dark, gradient-rich aurora.
*   Key accent color (e.g., links, active navigation): `#00ffd5` (cyan/teal).

### 5. Background Effects (Aurora)

Managed by `app/styles/components/aurora.css` and `app/components/aurora/AuroraBlob.tsx`.

*   **`.aurora-bg`:**
    *   A `position: fixed` element providing a static CSS gradient background covering the entire viewport.
    *   `z-index: -1` to sit behind all content.
*   **`.aurora-blob` & `AuroraBlob.tsx`:**
    *   Multiple `motion.div` components styled as blurred, colored blobs.
    *   Animated using `framer-motion` for subtle, continuous movement and opacity changes.
    *   `mix-blend-mode: lighten;` to interact with the background and each other.
    *   Responsive: Blobs are smaller and have less blur on smaller screens.
*   **iOS Specific Handling (`app/page.tsx`):**
    *   If iOS is detected, the animated `AuroraBlob` components are not rendered.
    *   The `.aurora-bg` has its `background` style potentially overridden to a simpler `#2d174d` if `isIOS` is true (as per logic in `app/page.tsx`). This is to improve performance on iOS devices.

### 6. Cursor Light Effect

Provides a subtle light effect that follows the mouse cursor.

*   **Logic (`app/page.tsx`):**
    *   Uses `framer-motion`'s `useMotionValue` and `useSpring` to create smooth X and Y coordinates for the light effect.
    *   The `handleMouseMove` event (throttled using `lodash.throttle`) updates these motion values.
*   **Styling (`app/styles/components/aurora.css` - `.cursor-circle`):**
    *   A `position: fixed` div.
    *   Styled as a radial gradient, blurred, to create a soft light spot.
    *   `pointer-events: none;` so it doesn't interfere with mouse interactions.
    *   `z-index: 999` to be above most content but below critical UI like modals if any.
*   **Mobile:** The cursor effect is not rendered on mobile devices (checked via `isMobile` state in `app/page.tsx`).

### 7. Global CSS Organization & TailwindCSS

*   The project heavily utilizes **TailwindCSS** for utility-first styling. Tailwind is configured in `tailwind.config.js` (not provided, but assumed) and its directives are imported in `app/globals.css`.
*   **Modular CSS:** Custom styles are organized into separate CSS files (e.g., `aurora.css`, `navigation.css`, etc.) and imported into `app/globals.css`. This promotes better organization than having all custom styles directly in `globals.css`.
